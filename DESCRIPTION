Description: Multi-Fidelity emulator for data from computer simulations of the
    same underlying system but at different input locations and fidelity level,
    where both the input locations and fidelity level can be continuous. Active
    Learning can be performed with an implementation of the IMSPE 
    criterion developed by Boutelet and Sung (2025, <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2503.23158>).
